Create an enclosure for the DMC2 electronics that is away from the mill

# This is a work in progress

As you are likely aware, the original enclosure for the DMC2 electronics is somewhat limiting.
In addition, the 12v power supplies are unsafe and will be replaced in my rebuild with a DIN mounted one.

As the DMC2 mill has cooling fluids, the electonics enclosure should be water resistant from splashes.

I will attempt to list the parts I used along with pictures of my results.

According to various people on the DMC2 users group on FB, a 24"x20"x10" enclosure will be large enough to
nicely layout all the parts without crowding everyhing.   The Z axis cables will need to be longer as I am 
putting the electronics to the bottom right of my rolling cart. If the electronics were behind the machine, 
the current Z cable length would likely be fine. I will also need to extend the end stop wires and various 
power cables.

I am thinking of adding an emergency power switch that kills ALL power to the system.

If you assembled the DMC2 yourself, you should already have most (if not all of the following parts). 

Equipment Needed.  
-power drill, various sized bits.  
-ferrel crimper.  
-metal files.  
-wire cutters.  
-wire strippers.  
-wrenches.  

Parts List.  
-DMC2  
-tool cart (if you need a mobile solution and your mill isn't on a bench).  
-various nuts and bolts for mounting  
-parts from table below

## Pictures

The enclosure after unpacking it from Amazon, pretty heavy

I held the box against the side of my rolling cart, traced out the hole pattern and then drilled them out for rivnuts.
The box uses M8 bolts.

I re-used the top rain shield as a bottom cable rack, it will need reenforcement to not bend.
