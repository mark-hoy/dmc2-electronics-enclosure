Create an enclosure for the DMC2 electronics that is away from the mill

# This is a work in progress

As you are likely aware, the original enclosure for the DMC2 electronics is somewhat limiting.
In addition, the 12v power supplies are unsafe and will be replaced in my rebuild with a DIN mounted one.

As the DMC2 mill has cooling fluids, the electonics enclosure should be water resistant from splashes.

I will attempt to list the parts I used along with pictures of my results.

According to various people on the DMC2 users group on FB, a 24"x20"x10" enclosure will be large enough to
nicely layout all the parts without crowding everyhing.  

I am thinking of adding an emergency power switch that kills ALL power to the system.

If you assembled the DMC2 yourself, you should already have most (if not all of the following parts). 

Equipment Needed.  
-power drill, various sized bits.  
-ferrel crimper.  
-metal files.  
-wire cutters.  
-wire strippers.  
-wrenches.  

Parts List.  
-DMC2  
-tool cart (if you need a mobile solution and your mill isn't on a bench).  
-various nuts and bolts for mounting  
-parts from table below
